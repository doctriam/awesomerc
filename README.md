# Awesome Config

#### Manjaro XFCE Community Edition
I installed [Awesome
WM](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/awesome/) on a system running Manjaro XFCE Community Edition.
Whatever wasn't working the way I wanted, I changed, not really knowing or
caring what other stuff was running underneath it all.

#### Widgets:
* [streetturtle](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets)
    * [batteryarc-widget](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets/tree/master/batteryarc-widget)
    * [volumearc-widget](https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgets/tree/master/volumearc-widget)
* [deficient](https://github.com/deficient)
    * [volume-control](https://github.com/deficient/volume-control)
* [i3](https://github.com/i3)
    * [i3lock](https://github.com/i3/i3lock)


#### Added Shortcuts:

* system hibernate (MOD + z)
* xfce4-screenshooter (MOD + Shift + s)
* laptop monitor switch (F8): single monitor, auto-sized
